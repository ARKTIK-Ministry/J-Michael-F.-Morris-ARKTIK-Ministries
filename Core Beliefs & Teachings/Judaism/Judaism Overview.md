# Judaism Overview

### Introduction
Judaism is a monotheistic faith that traces its origins to over 3,500 years ago, centering on the covenantal relationship between the Jewish people and G-D. The Jewish faith is built upon a rich tapestry of traditions, laws, and cultural practices, deeply rooted in the Torah and guided by millennia of interpretation and community development. From its ancient origins to modern-day expressions, Judaism encompasses a wide diversity of beliefs and practices across different communities worldwide. ARKTIK seeks to honor and promote respect, understanding, and engagement with the entire Jewish family, including often-marginalized or lesser-known groups.

### Core Beliefs

1. **Monotheism**
   - Judaism is founded on the belief in one, indivisible G-D, who is the Creator and sustainer of the universe. This belief is expressed daily in the Shema, a central declaration of faith: "Hear, O Israel: the L-RD our G-D, the L-RD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4).

2. **Covenantal Relationship**
   - The relationship between G-D and the Jewish people is rooted in a covenant established with the patriarchs—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—and reaffirmed at Mount Sinai. This covenant calls for the Jewish people to observe G-D’s commandments and live as a "light unto the nations."

3. **The Torah and Halakha (Jewish Law)**
   - The Torah, the foundational text of Judaism, contains 613 commandments (mitzvot) that guide daily life. Halakha (Jewish law) provides the framework for ethical living, ritual practice, and communal obligations.

4. **Ethical Living and Mitzvot**
   - Observance of mitzvot encompasses both ritual commandments and ethical obligations, such as acts of kindness, charity (tzedakah), and justice. Ethical behavior is central to Jewish identity and purpose.

5. **Messianic Belief**
   - Many Jewish traditions maintain a belief in the coming of the Messiah (Mashiach), who will bring peace and redemption to the world. For some, this hope is understood symbolically, emphasizing collective efforts to repair the world (tikkun olam).

### Major Traditions and Practices

1. **Prayer and Worship**
   - Jewish prayer is a daily practice, with formal prayers recited in the morning (Shacharit), afternoon (Mincha), and evening (Ma’ariv). Communal worship often takes place in synagogues, where the liturgy emphasizes praise, thanksgiving, and requests for G-D’s guidance.

2. **Shabbat (Sabbath)**
   - Shabbat is a weekly day of rest and spiritual renewal, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening. It commemorates G-D’s creation of the world and is marked by prayer, communal meals, and abstention from work.

3. **Jewish Holidays**
   - Jewish holidays commemorate key events in Jewish history and provide moments for spiritual reflection and community gathering. Major holidays include:
     - **Passover (Pesach)**: Celebrating the Israelites' liberation from Egypt.
     - **Rosh Hashanah**: The Jewish New Year, a time of self-reflection and repentance.
     - **Yom Kippur**: The Day of Atonement, focused on seeking forgiveness and spiritual renewal.
     - **Sukkot, Hanukkah, Purim, and Shavuot**: Each with unique rituals and themes that connect Jews to their faith and history.

4. **Dietary Laws (Kashrut)**
   - Observant Jews follow kashrut (dietary laws), which dictate permissible and forbidden foods and their preparation. Keeping kosher is an expression of mindfulness and holiness.

5. **Life Cycle Events**
   - Key rituals mark significant milestones in a Jewish person’s life, including:
     - **Brit Milah (Circumcision)**: Covenant ritual performed on the eighth day for boys.
     - **Bar/Bat Mitzvah**: Coming-of-age ceremony at age 13 (12 for girls in some traditions), signifying adult responsibility for mitzvot.
     - **Marriage**: Sanctified through traditional rituals, including the ketubah (marriage contract) and breaking of the glass.
     - **Death and Mourning**: Jewish customs emphasize honoring the deceased, with timely burial, recitation of the Kaddish, and mourning periods.

### Embracing the Full Jewish Family: Diverse Communities

1. **Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel)**
   - The Ethiopian Jewish community, known as Beta Israel, has a rich heritage rooted in ancient Jewish practices. They maintained traditions such as observing dietary laws, celebrating Jewish holidays, and adhering to ritual purity laws. Beta Israel’s aliyah (immigration) to Israel and subsequent challenges highlight the importance of embracing and supporting marginalized Jewish communities.

2. **Yemeni Jews**
   - Yemeni Jews have a distinctive liturgical tradition, musical style, and Hebrew pronunciation. They have preserved ancient Torah scrolls and unique customs that reflect centuries of living in Yemen, often under difficult circumstances.

3. **Lemba (Limba) Jews of Africa**
   - The Lemba people, primarily in southern Africa, maintain oral traditions and practices that reflect Jewish identity, including dietary laws, male circumcision, and claims of descent from ancient Jewish traders. Genetic evidence has linked some Lemba with Jewish priestly lineages (Cohenim), highlighting their unique connection to the Jewish world.

4. **Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews**
   - **Sephardic Jews** trace their heritage to Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East, with a rich tradition of liturgical music, customs, and cuisine.
   - **Ashkenazi Jews** originate from Central and Eastern Europe, with distinct Yiddish culture, customs, and rabbinic scholarship. Their influence on modern Jewish thought and practice is profound.

5. **Conversos, Crypto-Jews, and Marginalized Communities**
   - Many Jews throughout history were forced to convert or practice Judaism in secret, including conversos of the Iberian Peninsula and hidden Jewish communities across the globe. Recognition and support for their unique journeys and re-emergence in Jewish life are essential for building unity.

6. **Genetic Jews and Descendants**
   - ARKTIK acknowledges the diversity of Jewish identity, including those with genetic ties to Judaism who have faced marginalization. Reconnecting and welcoming these individuals strengthens Jewish unity and honors shared heritage.
