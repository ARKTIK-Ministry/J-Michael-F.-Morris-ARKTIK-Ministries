### Structure of Morning Prayers

1. **Morning Offering**
   - *Prayer*:  
     "Heavenly Father, I offer You this day, all that I think, do, and say. Please bless me and make me strong in Your service. Amen."
   - **Contemplative Practice**: As you say this prayer, reflect on dedicating your thoughts, words, and actions to the service of GOD throughout the day.

2. **Prayer of Gratitude**
   - *Prayer*:  
     "Thank You, LORD, for the gift of this new day. Thank You for the breath in my lungs and the light of the morning. Guide my steps, O LORD, and keep me on Your path."
   - **Scripture Reference**: "This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it." - Psalm 118:24
   - **Contemplative Practice**: Spend a moment reflecting on the blessings you have received and express gratitude for specific aspects of your life.

3. **The Lord's Prayer (Our Father)**
   - *Prayer*:  
     "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen."
   - **Contemplative Practice**: Recite this prayer slowly, meditating on each phrase and its meaning. Consider how it applies to your needs and intentions for the day.

     "LORD, I come before You seeking strength and guidance for this day. Help me to face every challenge with courage and grace. Fill me with Your Spirit, that I may reflect Your love and truth in all that I do. Amen."
