# ARKTIK ACCESS: Witnessing Sacred Sessions

Observers are expected to uphold the highest standards of etiquette and professionalism, reflecting ARKTIK's commitment to fostering a sacred space of understanding, compassion, and mutual growth.


##  **Key Principles of ARKTIK ACCESS**

* **A Privilege, Not a Right:**  ARKTIK ACCESS is a privilege extended to guests, not an inherent right. Access is granted solely through the unanimous consent of all active session participants. The comfort and sanctity of the participants' space are paramount.

Observers are expected to embody ARKTIK's core values of compassion, understanding, respect, patriotism, and Masonic principles, including integrity, brotherly love, and service to others.
* **Consent-Based Access:**  ARKTIK ACCESS is granted only when every active participant in a session feels comfortable with an observer's presence. If any participant expresses discomfort, the observation request will be respectfully declined, prioritizing the participants' right to a safe and sacred space.
* **Spectator Role:**  Observers are strictly non-participatory unless explicitly invited by the facilitator with the unanimous consent of all participants. Observers must maintain a respectful and unobtrusive presence, honoring the sacred nature of the session.
