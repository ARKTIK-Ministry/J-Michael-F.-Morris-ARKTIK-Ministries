### Movement as Worship: Bridging Faith and Physical Health

**Exercise as a Form of Devotion**  
Imagine approaching exercise as a sacred act of devotion. Whether through simple stretches inspired by ritual postures or mindful walks that echo spiritual reflection, physical movement can honor the body as a temple. In moments of prayer, consider how your breath, posture, and movement bring you closer to the divine presence.

**Postures of Prayer and Physical Benefits**  
- **Prostration**: Common in Islamic prayers, prostration stretches the back, engages the core, and calms the mind. It’s a humble act with powerful physical benefits.
- **Kneeling and Standing**: These acts, found in Christian and Jewish worship, promote circulation, strengthen the lower body, and improve focus.
- **Intentional Breathing**: Across all Abrahamic traditions, breath plays a role in centering the mind and calming the spirit. Deep, intentional breaths oxygenate the body, reduce stress, and promote mental clarity.
